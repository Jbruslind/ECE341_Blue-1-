#	Schematic files
This folder contains all the schematic files as pdfs for easy viewing. The project
was designed using the Altium Circuitmaker software. All project files are open 
for anyone to use and can be found in the project search engine within Circuitmaker. 
##	MCU

This is the ESP32 general connection page which provides ports to the other 
necessary sheets within the project. The ESP needs a 3.3V VDD and all its pins
are 3.3V tolerant (not 5V). The inputs are for the I2C bus, 2 radiometric current sensors, 
3 relay control lines, UART programming, and for power/gnd.

The BJTs are used for programming the ESP over USB (seen below in the UART->TTL bridge).
The switches on EN and IO0 are used for programming and resetting respectively.

##	UART Bridge

 The ESP32 does not have a native way to communicate over UART (USB signals), so a UART-TTL bridge
 was chosen to preform that job. The Silabs CP2012 is a popular choice among other microcontroller
 development boards and has a proven design. This chip will take in the USB signals from some external
 controller and program the ESP32. 
 
 ##	3.3V LDO

 The input voltage that we are using for this board is expected to be 4.5 - 5.5V. The ESP32 and 
 the other peripheral sensors cannot tolerate this voltage normally. So a Low Dropout Regulator
 was chosen to step this 5V voltage down to 3.3V. This was chosen to be the LM1117 which is, again,
 a popular choice among development boards for 3.3V supplies.
