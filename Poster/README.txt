This project was for ECE 341/2 at Oregon State University. At the end of the second term, teams 
would show off their projects at a Junior Design Expo. This was the poster used to show off this 
project on 3/14/19 by Bluetooth Switch group 1. 

This folder contains all of the artifacts and pictures used to decorate the poster. These include 
mechanical drawings of the case, a rendering of the populated PCB, a block diagram of the entire
system, a graph showcasing the sampling technique used to calculate RMS values, and a picture of
the user interface for both the smartphone app and web interface respectively.
